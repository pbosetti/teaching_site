At the [Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Trento](https://dii.unitn.it), I am teaching master courses (in English) and undergraduate courses (in Italian). Most of the teaching material used in these courses is available here.

If you are a student of the University of Trento, note that this is NOT the main support site: look at the [Moodle platform](https://didatticaonline.unitn.it/dol/) instead.
